        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Alert Warning Project is a comprehensive system designed to provide rapid, reliable, and targeted warnings for various types of emergencies and critical situations. Our goal is to enhance public safety and reduce response times during critical events.</p>
        <p>Curvy roads often pose significant safety challenges due to limited visibility, especially when vehicles approach blind spots caused by natural or man-made obstacles (e.g., trees, rocks, barriers). Lack of awareness regarding oncoming traffic can lead to dangerous situations such as head-on collisions. An intelligent warning system using sensors can improve road safety by alerting drivers of approaching vehicles they cannot see.
    Today, road traffic injuries are one of the leading causes of death, disabilities and hospitalization in the country. There are many dangerous roads in the world like mountain roads, narrow curve roads, T roads. The problem in these curve roads is drivers cannot able to see the vehicle or obstacles coming from other end of the curve. To avoid these problems in curve roads or roads we are introducing sensor based accident prevention system.</p>

        <h2>Purposed Work & Working Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            We are setting two sensors and two indicators at curvy roads. Sensor-1 and Sensor-2 are cross connected with Indicator -1 and Indicator-2 i.e. sensor-1 connected to indicator-2 and sensor-2 is connected to indicator-1. Sensor-1 detects vehicle from one side of curve and create sensor reading. The sensor -1 transfers that reading to indicator-2, which is set on opposite part of that road. Indicator-2 displays alert message for vehicles on opposite side of road. 
            Similar process happens with sensor-2 and indicator-1. In this way, we can warn vehicles on opposite side of curvy roads about the incoming vehicles from another side. In this way we can minimize fatal accidents on curvy roads by using this alert warning module. Simultaneously, when both sensors detect vehicle they transfer the sensor reading to computer of nearby RTO office so that they can use this data for various surveys. For example, they can use these data for survey of daily vehicle passing from that road. These sensor readings are stored in RTO's database.  </p>
            <p>Alert systems for highway turns have lots of potential to enhance road safety. By using accident alert system with AI , sensors and dashboards we can reduce amounts of accidents caused on road turns neatly. As these systems continue to evolve, they promise to make highways safer, ultimately saving lives and improving the overall driving experience.
