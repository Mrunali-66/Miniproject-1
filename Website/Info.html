                <h2>How an accident is fatal?</h2>
                <p>Vehicle collisions on curved roads, especially at turns, 
                    are a significant cause of traffic accidents. 
               These accidents often result in severe injuries, 
                    fatalities, and substantial  property damage. 
               Understanding the factors contributing to such
                   accidents is crucial for developing effective prevention
                   strategies.
               </p>
                <p>Due to insufficient visibility of oncoming vehicles, drivers on Curvy Road frequently encounter unexpected vehicular collisions. This persistent issue arises from inadequate road design, poor lighting, or visual obstructions, resulting in hazardous driving conditions and increased accident rates. A comprehensive investigation is required to identify the specific causes and implement effective solutions to enhance road safety and reduce collision occurrences.</p>
